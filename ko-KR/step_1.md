## Introduction

Create your own fun and frantic version of the classic game Snake on a Sense HAT: guide the slug around the screen to let her eat vegetables, watch her grow, and increase your score. Don't let her bite into herself though, or it's game over!

### What you will make

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to direct the slug. Click **Run** to start the game. <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/b9e8a05f5b?outputOnly=true" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
