## Introduction

Create your own fun and frantic version of the classic game "snake" using a Sense HAT. Guide the slug around the screen, eating vegetables to make her grow bigger. Don't eat yourself though or it's game over!

### What you will make

Use the up, down, left and right keys on your keyboard to move the slug. Click **Run** to start the game.
