## Introduction

Create your own fun and frantic version of the classic game Snake on a Sense HAT: guide a slug around the screen to let it eat vegetables which will make her grow bigger. Don't let her eat herself though, or it's game over!

### What you will make

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to direct the slug. Click **Run** to start the game.
