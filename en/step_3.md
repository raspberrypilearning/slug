## Connect to the Sense HAT

+ If you have a Sense HAT, attach it to your Raspberry Pi.

[[[rpi-sensehat-attach]]]

+ If you do not have a Sense HAT, you could create the project using the Sense HAT emulator.

[[[rpi-sensehat-emulator]]]

+ Open up the [starter file]() if you are using a hardware Sense HAT or the [starter trinket]() if you are using the trinket emulator.

This file contains the code to connect to the Sense HAT, imports the modules you will need and provides a structure for your code.
