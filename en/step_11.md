## Challenge:

There are lots of possibilities you could add to your game to make it more difficult and entertaining for the player.

+ Growth vegetables - add a new type of vegetable which causes the slug to grow by more than one segment at a time. This makes the game harder for the player because there is more of the slug to potentially run into!

+ Slug trails - leave a trail behind your slug in a different colour so you can see where you've been. Perhaps vegetables might not generate in spaces where there is a slug trail, making the game harder?

+ Digest your veg - when you eat a vegetable, add code so that you can see the vegetable working its way through the slug's digestive system and being pooped out of the end! Perhaps you could make the game also end if the slug enters a space containing a pooped out vegetable? Yuck!
