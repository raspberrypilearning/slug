## Challenge: crazy veggies

There are lots of possible features you could add to your game to make it more difficult and entertaining for the player! Here are a few examples — can you come up with your own ideas?

+ Growth vegetables: add a new type of vegetable which causes the slug to grow by more than one segment at a time. This makes the game harder because the slug will become big quickly, making it difficult to stop her from biting herself!

+ Slug trails: leave a trail behind your slug in a different colour so you can see where you've been. Perhaps you could then make the game harder by not allowing vegetables to be generated in spaces where there is a slug trail?

+ Digest your veg: add code so that, when the slug eats a vegetable, you can see it working its way through the slug's digestive system and getting pooped out of the end! Perhaps you could make the game also end if the slug moves to a space with a pooped-out vegetable? Yuck!
