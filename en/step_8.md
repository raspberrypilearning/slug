## Eating vegetables

Your slug already appears to eat the vegetables â€” great! However, you have probably found that, once she has eaten the first three vegetables, no more vegetables ever appear regardless of how long you wait.

**Can you work out why this is?**

Since the `make_veg` function only generates vegetables if the `vegetables` list contains fewer than three items, no new vegetables will appear once the list contains three vegetables.

At the moment, your first three vegetables are generated and added to the `vegetables` list. When the slug moves to a pixel containing a vegetable, the vegetable disappears because the `move` function draws the slug's pixels over the top of it. This is why the slug appears to eat it. However, the vegetable is never removed from the `vegetables` list, so the `make_veg` function isn't allowed to make more.

+ Add some code at the end of the `move()` function so that, whenever the slug moves to a new pixel, the function checks whether that pixel is in the `vegetables` list. If the pixel is in the `vegetables` list, remove it from the list.

Let's also add a score to keep track of how many vegetables the slug has eaten, so that the player knows how well they have done when their round ends.

+ In the variables section, create a `score` variable which starts as `0`.

+ Whenever the slug eats a vegetable, add 1 to the score. Don't forget that, because the `score` variable was created outside of the function, you need to specify that you want to use `global score` at the start of the `move()` function so that the function is allowed to change it.

Here is some pseudocode for the check which should occur within the `move()` function:

`if` new pixel is `in` vegetables
`remove` new pixel from vegetables
`add` 1 to score

Here is the code you should add to the end of the `move()` function:

```python
if next in vegetables:
  vegetables.remove(next)
  score += 1
```

Don't forget to also add `global score` on the first line of the `move()` function, and to initialise the `score` variable to `0` in the variables section.
